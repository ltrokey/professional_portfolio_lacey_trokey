## Description

In my professional portfolio, I've skillfully merged my background in art and construction with my developing expertise as I showcase my HTML and CSS skills through a theme centered around one of my original art pieces. Notably, I've mastered responsive design to ensure seamless cross-device experiences and refined project structuring for better maintainability. Overcoming challenges, the most prominent being integrating a background image extending onto the navigation bar giving the illusion of branches emerging and also adapting the responsive layout from large to small screens, which has added depth to my problem-solving abilities. This portfolio reflects my growth as a developer, embodying the fusion of creativity and technical prowess.
